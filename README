The "ehstr.h" header file defines:

* utob, for printing values as strings of "0"s and "1"s
   (stdlib.h "strtoul" can be used to round-trip)
* revstr, to reverse the contents of a string in place
   (converts big to little endian)
* decimal_to_hex, to convert an strings of decimal digits to hex
   (arbitrarily long strings, treats as unsigned)
* hex_to_decimal, converts hex back to decimal
   (also arbitrarily long strings, also treats as unsigned)
* trimstr, to trim leading and trailing whitespace from a string
   (in place)
* strnlen, for environments which only have strlen
